Hi, I'm Bot1, your digital assistant. I can help with all sorts of every day banking queries.

I understand you would like to carry out a financial health check?

Do you have any questions before we start?

    Why do I need a financial health check?

Whether you're looking for peace of mind or to find out something specific, the Financial Health Check could do the job.

The focus is around your needs and goals. We'll consider all areas of your finances so we could help you make the best decisions.

...

Great. We want to make sure before guiding you in any direction, we understand your personal financial health and situation implicitly.

We need to go through a basic health check to make sure your foundations are in place. Before you can move into investing.

Based on the information I have on you so far, I'll need to ask about 8 questions to fill the remaining gaps and provide you with personalised guidance:

Ready to proceed?

[Yes] [No]

    Yes

Great let's get started.

Question 1 of 8:
Has the increase in cost of living impact your ability to pay your bills each month?

[Yes] [No] [What does this mean?]

    Yes

Question 2 of 8:
Have you used your help to buy ISA?

[Yes] [No] [What does this mean?]

...

Ok, based on the information I understand about your circumstances, here are the options available to you:

1. Continue putting into a savings account

2. Open a stocks and shares ISA

3. Increase Pension contributions

    How much more would I earn from a stocks and shares ISA?

A stocks and shares ISA would bring a return of 400% vs if you kept your Â£10,000 in a savings account
