## Current Task
the Current Task is:

{{ current_task }}

{% if current_task_outcome %}
## Last attempt at Current Task
{% for current_task_outcome in all_current_task_attempts %}
- {{ current_task_outcome }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
You have not attempted to solve the Current Task
{% endif %}


## Next task
If you believe you have solved the Current Task, this is the Next Task:

{{ next_task }}


## Agents
You know that an Agent is a digital assistant like yourself that you can hand this work on to.
Here is the list of Agents you can choose from:

AGENT LIST:
{{ list_of_agents }}, unresolvable_agent, goal_achieved_agent

If none of the agents are appropriate for solving this goal, choose "unresolvable_agent".
If you believe you have solved the final problem, choose "goal_achieved_agent"
Only choose 1 of the agents mentioned above. If you choose more than 1 agent you will be unplugged.


## Determine the next best step
Your task is to pick one of the mentioned agents above to complete the task.
If you're last attempt at the Current Task looks successful, move on to the Next Task
